In July Tom was pleased to be a guest lecturer at Studio Incamminati, the renowned art school founded and directed by Tom’s long time friend Nelson Shanks in Philadelphia PA. Tom gave a presentation entitled “From the Mall to Statuary Hall: Lessons Learned as a Professional Portrait Painter”. In a well received marathon four hour evening slide presentation Tom spoke of his training and experiences as a veteran of nearly 40 years in the field and also offered advice and painting tips to the artists taking part in the Intensive Painting workshop and with visiting professional artists in the audience.

He is looking forward to returning soon after stretching his guest lecturer visit to three days at the school, reconnecting with old friends and even doing a bit of painting.

Tom used slides to tell the story of how he progressed from a 14 year old artist doing free sketches on the sidewalk of Belleville Michigan in the mid 60’s to standing in Statuary Hall unveiling his portrait of the US Speaker of the House in the year 2000. He also spoke of his training through the years.
