Lois Nash holds her Gold Medal following the ceremony at the Capitol

Tom accompanied his mother Lois to Washington DC in March of 2010 to attend the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony at the US Capitol.  Lois was one of 1012 WASP, the Womenâ€™s Airforce Service Pilots, during WWII.  She flew over 17 different planes including her favorite, the B-26 Bomber which she used to tow targets.   Over 200 surviving WASP were able to make the trip to Washington and accept their Gold Medals in person.   Click [here](http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123194315) to read more.
