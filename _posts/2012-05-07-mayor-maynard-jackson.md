![Portrait of Maynard Jackson](/news/maynard-jackson-progress-208w.jpg)

Tom is making progress on his painting of former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson which will hang at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when completed.  Here Tom surrounded himself with full size charcoal sketches and several studies in oil or charcoal while in the planning stages of the painting.

In addition to recognizing his stature and ability as a painter of official portraits, the selection of Thomas Nash to paint the late Mayor is just one more acknowledgment of Nash's particular skills as a specialist in the painting of the posthumous portrait.
