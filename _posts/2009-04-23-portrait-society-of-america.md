On Thursday evening, April 23 during the annual Portrait Society of America “Art of the Portrait” conference in Reston VA, Tom was among leading artists who gathered in the Grand Ballroom and painted demonstrations from the same live models. The finished paintings were well received and all were sold in a silent auction during the conference.

Thomas Nash is a full time professional portrait painter and although he enjoys teaching and is very good at it, his own painting and study restricts his teaching schedule. If you are serious about taking your Portrait painting to the next level, don’t miss one of the live workshops.

In addition to painting from the model, Nash workshops include
helpful classroom portions on a variety of aspects of Portrait painting.
